# 💡 Why PumpDomains ?
• PumpDomains offers a decentralized platform where meme token creators can build custom domains directly integrated with their token’s economy. The platform enhances token value by employing a deflationary burn mechanism on each domain creation. By leveraging blockchain technology, PumpDomains ensures transparency, utility, and growth for meme token communities, driving engagement and market participation.

# 🌱 Key Features

1. **Custom Domain Creation**: Users can create unique domains linked to their meme tokens
2. **Deflationary Token Burn**: A portion of the token supply is burned for every new domain, reducing circulation
3. **Domain Management**: Simple and intuitive interface for claiming, renewing, and transferring domains
4. **Token Integration**: Automatically buy and burn tokens associated with the domain
5. **Ownership & Control**: Meme token creators maintain ownership of their domains
6. **Market Data Integration**: Live token data integration ensures dynamic interaction with token metrics

# ❓FAQs

1. **How does PumpDomains increase token value?**

    Answer: Every time a user creates a domain, a portion of the meme token supply is burned, reducing the total supply and increasing scarcity, which can lead to a rise in token value.

2. **What happens if I transfer my domain?**

    Answer: Domains are fully transferable on the blockchain, and ownership rights are automatically updated through our smart contracts, ensuring the new owner has complete control over the domain.

3. **How does the platform validate token burns?**

    Answer: The platform integrates with live token data to ensure accurate token burning through smart contracts. Each domain creation triggers the burn, which is then recorded on the blockchain for transparency.

4. **What is the cost to create a domain?**

    Answer: The cost depends on the length of the domain name. For instance, domains with 3 characters cost 10 TRX, while those with 5 or more characters cost 3 TRX. The platform automatically calculates the cost based on domain length.
