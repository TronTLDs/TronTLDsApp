# 💡 Why PumpDomains ?
 PumpDomains offers a decentralized platform where meme token creators can build custom domains directly integrated with their token’s economy. The platform enhances token value by employing a deflationary burn mechanism on each domain creation. By leveraging blockchain technology, PumpDomains ensures transparency, utility, and growth for meme token communities, driving engagement and market participation.

# 🌱 Key Features

1. **Custom Domain Creation**: Users can create unique domains linked to their meme tokens
2. **Deflationary Token Burn**: A portion of the token supply is burned for every new domain, reducing circulation
3. **Domain Management**: Simple and intuitive interface for claiming, renewing, and transferring domains
4. **Token Integration**: Automatically buy and burn tokens associated with the domain
5. **Ownership & Control**: Meme token creators maintain ownership of their domains
6. **Market Data Integration**: Live token data integration ensures dynamic interaction with token metrics

# ❓FAQs

1. **How does PumpDomains increase token value?**

Every time a user creates a domain, a portion of the meme token supply is burned, reducing the total supply and increasing scarcity, which can lead to a rise in token value.

2. **How does the platform validate token burns?**

The platform integrates with live token data to ensure accurate token burning through smart contracts. Each domain creation triggers the burn, which is then recorded on the blockchain for transparency.

3. **What is the cost to create a domain?**

The cost depends on the length of the domain name. For instance, domains with 3 characters cost 10 TRX, while those with 5 or more characters cost 3 TRX. The platform automatically calculates the cost based on domain length.

4. **What percentage of the memetoken is burned during domain creation?**

When a TLD or domain is created, 80% of the fee goes towards a memetoken buyback and burn, while the remaining 20% is retained by the platform.

5. **How does the platform generate revenue from domain creation?**

Revenue is generated through fees for TLD deployment and domain registrations. 80% of the fee supports token buyback and burn, and 20% is kept as platform revenue.

6. **Are there any fees involved in creating a domain?**

Yes, domain creation is not free. Users pay a fee, with 80% going towards token buyback and burn, and 20% allocated to the platform.
